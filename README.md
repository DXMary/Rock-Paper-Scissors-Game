<h2 align="center">Rock, Paper & Scissors Game</h2>

This is my first solo project after going through few Python tutorials and training materials. The program will allow users to play the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.

<h4>Program features:</h4>

- Player vs Computer.
- Prompting the user to input the number of rounds it wants to play.
- Prompting the user to choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Instructing the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Comparing the user's choice and the computer's choice.
- Providing a score for each round.
- Determining a winner (the user or the computer).
- Informing the user who the winner is.
- Giving the option to the user to quit mid-game.
- Formatted text.
- Replay.

<h4>Development setup:</h4>

```sh
import random

```

This is my first solo project after going through few Python tutorials and training materials. The program will allow users to play the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer.

- Prompting the user to choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Instructing the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Comparing the user's choice and the computer's choice.
- Providing a score for each round.
- Determining a winner (the user or the computer).
- Informing the user who the winner is.
- Giving the option to the user to quit mid-game.

<h4>Project Status:</h4>

The project is currently in progress. I will be working on it further to add the following features:

- Playes vs player.
- Web or GUI interface for visualization.
- Different modes: easy, hard, impossible.
- Impossible mode where AI attempts to determine user's move in advance so user always loses.

Thanks for checking out my program!
